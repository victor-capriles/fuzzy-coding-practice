ðŸš— Smart Parking Lot System (OOP Challenge in JavaScript)
Scenario:
You are building a small smart parking lot system. The parking lot has a limited number of spots, and different types of vehicles (car, motorcycle, truck) take up space differently.

Requirements

- Classes to create:
    Vehicle (base class)
        Properties:
            licensePlate
            size ("small", "medium", "large")

        Methods:
            getSpotsRequired() must be implemented by subclasses

    Car (subclass of Vehicle)
        Default size: "medium"
        Implements getSpotsRequired() â†’ returns 1

    Motorcycle (subclass of Vehicle)
        Default size: "small"
        Implements getSpotsRequired() â†’ returns 1

    Truck (subclass of Vehicle)
        Default size: "large"
        Implements getSpotsRequired() â†’ returns 2

    ParkingLot
        Properties:
            capacity â†’ total number of spots available
            spots â†’ array of parked vehicles

        Methods:
        park(vehicle)
            Calls vehicle.getSpotsRequired()
            If there is enough space, parks the vehicle and updates spots
            Otherwise, prints "Not enough space!"

        leave(licensePlate)
            Removes a vehicle with the given licensePlate from the lot
            Frees up its spots

        status()
            Prints total spots, remaining free spots, and a list of parked vehicles (licensePlate + type)

- Rules:
    A motorcycle takes 1 spot.
    A car takes 1 spot.
    A truck takes 2 spots.
    If thereâ€™s not enough space, the vehicle canâ€™t be parked.
    ParkingLot should work without knowing the vehicle type (only through polymorphism).
